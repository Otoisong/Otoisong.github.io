# My first project
## is a blend of
### coding in Python and
#### my newfound
##### love for Coffee!


---

I’ve recently discovered my growing love for coffee, and I’m excited to see how it fuels my coding sessions.
Here's a piece of code that captures my journey of coding in Python, with coffee now by my side (and I’m starting to enjoy it!).

```
my_love_for_python = 0
my_python_knowledge = 0

for day in lifetime:
    my_love_for_python += 1
    my_python_knowledge += 1
```

Just so you really see how much I love Python, here is some code BUT with some colours for keywords & functionality!

```python
my_love_for_python = 0
my_python_knowledge = 0

for day in lifetime:
    my_love_for_python += 1
    my_python_knowledge += 1  
```

Here’s an unordered list of things I absolutely love about Python (and the growing appeal of coffee in my life):

For my work
Data Analysis
Data Visualization
Machine Learning
For personal interest
Deep Learning
Computer Vision
Experimenting with coffee as my new coding partner
Here’s an ordered list of what I’m discovering about coffee and why I’m starting to love it:

The taste
At first, I wasn’t sure, but I’m really getting into it now!
The aroma
The energy boost that keeps me coding for hours
Now that I’ve embraced coffee, here’s the image from the top of this post, now included in the body of my work to show my excitement!

This image is linked directly from my GitHub repository, though I could also easily link images from online sources!

A quick line break here helps me refocus—especially after a few cups of coffee that have me coding non-stop.

I could add more fun elements like links, tables, or quotes, but for now, I’m going to take a short break to enjoy another cup of coffee.
